this repo contains the code for what will hopefully soon be my website.

### prepare website to go live
- open terminal
- run `npm run build`
- a directory called `dist` will be created with all the files of the website
- archive the `dist` directory or the files inside the `dist` directory
- upload the archive the `public_html` directory
- extract the content of the archive inside the directory `public_html`
